## How do I generate an Avatar?

As in [glossary](./glossary), technically, Avatar
is the same as Ethereum wallet: they're both `secp256k1` elliptic
curve asymmetric keypair.

So, generating and managing Avatr should be the same as generating /
managing wallets. Search for an `secp256k1` SDK in your project's
programming language to generate one.

:::note
Basiclly,

- secret key should be 32-bytes long
- public key has 2 shapes:
  - Uncompressed(65-bytes, started with `0x04`), or
  - compressed(33-bytes, started with `0x02` or `0x03`, in most case `0x02`)

## I got `"bad signature"` error in [`POST /v1/proof`](../rest-api/proofservice-api#proof-add) {#bad-signature}

1. Check if `created_at` and `uuid` is the same as [`POST /v1/proof/payload`](../rest-api/proofservice-api#proof-payload) result.
2. Check if you're using [Ethereum Personal Sign](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js/blob/1.x/docs/web3-eth-personal.rst#sign).
   - If your DApp is using wallet SDK (e.g. MetaMask), make sure
     you're using correct signature RPC method.

:::tip How do I implement personal sign by myself?
- In pseudo-code, `personal_sign` is:
```javascript
sign(keccak256("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n" + dataToSign.length + dataToSign)))
```
- Make sure `dataToSign.length` is length of bytes (`Buffer`
  length in some language), not UTF-8 [code
  point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point) length.
  ```go
  assert.Equal(4, len([]byte("üêé"))) // Not 1
  ```
- Signature should be 65-bytes long.

```elixir
<<r::binary-size(32), s::binary-size(32), v::binary-size(1)>> = signature_binary
# v should be 0x00 or 0x01 or 0x1B or 0x1C
# 0x00 is equivalent to 0x1B
# 0x01 is equivalent to 0x1C
```

Here's a test case.

```go
// Psuedo-code
// Given a signature payload
payload := "Test123123!"
// And your secret key
secret_key := "xxx"
// The personal sign result should be
assert.Equal(
  "0x52f210dadad13c4c8d0656e7380300a367a056631cf26950baa7de4f580187795c76b5fc94de5bd0b8af4d5df432687d900402cba86a12570af56be35ba8d56401",
  personal_sign(secret_key, payload).ToHexString()
)
```

## I got `public key mismatch` error in `POST /v1/kv` {#bad-signature}

See [ProofService FAQ](#bad-signature).

> Double check `dataToSign.length` part.

## Does KVService rely on an existed Avatar / binding on ProofService?

Not really! You can use this as a storage for every secp256k1 keypair
(`platform == nextid && identity == "0xPUBLIC_KEY"`) without even
using it on ProofService.

But, if you want to save data related to a specific account, we still
encourage you to put it under precise `platform` and `identity`.

A typical case is, your DApp allows user to set different NFT avatar
on Twitter and Github. In this case, `platform` and `identity` should
be specified (instead of being put under an ambiguous Avatar pubkey).
